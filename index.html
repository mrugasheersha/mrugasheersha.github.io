 	    <h2>About the class:</h2>
 	    The class promises to significantly improve your standing in mathematics. We plan to take a small number of students so we could personally cater to each student's weaknesses. Through the course you will learn the art of problem solving and have all your questions answered!<br><br>
            <h2>About the Teacher:</h2>
            <p>My name is Yashodhan Manerikar. I am a physicist-programmer.<br>
            I enjoy studying and teaching, and I am building towards a career in academia. I have ample experience in teaching over the years, mostly in college where I routinely gave talks as a part of the astronomy club. I have done a number of research projects in in astronomical research institutes in India, Germany and Russia. I have also worked as a software-engineer for 1.5 years. <br>
            Having a passionate teacher for any subject is important, especially when it comes to math. As I studied mathematics courses in IIT Madras as a physicist, I promise you a depth in this subject which you would rarely find in coaching classes.
