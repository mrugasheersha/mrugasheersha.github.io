            <h2>About the Teacher</h2>
            <p>My name is Yashodhan Manerikar and I have a passion for teaching. I went to IIT Madras for a dual degree in physics, graduating in 2021. I later worked as a software engineer for 1.5 years. I have worked at several international research institutes, namely TIFR/BARC, IUCAA, MPIA and SAI(MSU).<br> 
            I have helped discover candidates for exoplanets, discovered new variable stars and help create sophisticated AI models for industry.<br>
            I have been teaching in various capacities since my first year in college when I volunteered at an NGO in Chennai. From second year I routinely gave talks and lectures as a coordinator, head and mentor of the Horizon: Physics and Astronomy club of IIT Madras.<br>
            This class is a way to share my knowledge and mathematical intuition with ambitious students while supporting myself financially as I focus on my study, research and software projects.
